1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Hemodynamic may play an important role in other anomalies in the aorta. An overview of some of major
anomalies has been provided below.
Both the thoracic and abdominal aorta are prone to the development of aneurysms and hemodynamic and
biomechanical forces are thought to play a role in the progression of the disease and risk of rupture.
Rupture of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) carries a risk of death of up to 90%. They are more common in
men and are present in 1.3% of men aged 45-54 and 12.5% of men 75-84 years old. They are present in 0% and
5.2% of women in respective age groups. On the other hand, the prevalence of Thoracic aortic aneurysms is
equal in men and women with an incidence rate of 10.4 per 100,000 person-years.Thoracic aortic aneurysms
can occur as a result of aortic dissection, which can occur anywhere in the aorta but more often occur in the
thoracic aorta. Aortic dissection is a tear in the internal lining of the wall of the aorta. The prevalence of aortic
dissection is estimated to be around 2.9-3.5% per 100,000 person-years, a majority of which are male [1].
Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA) refers to the narrowing of any section of the aorta; however, CoA is most
commonly seen in the area immediately after the arch of the aorta, the site where the ductus arteriosus closes
[2]. CoA is the fifth of most common cardiovascular defect at birth, though it may also develop as a result of
other cardiovascular anomalies in infancy, adolescence, and early adulthood [3]. It accounts for 8-11% of
congenital heart defects in the U.S and affects about 1 out of 10,000 individuals of all ages [4, 5]. Despite the
various options for treatment, CoA has been associated with decreased in life expectancy and long term
morbidity [4].

2. Clinical Data

3. Anatomic Model Description
Anatomic models were created using customized SimVascular software (Simtk.org) and the image data
described in Section 2. The models extend from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta before the phrenic
arteries, including the brachiocephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian artery. See Appendix 2 for a
description of modeling methods. See Table 4 for a visual summary of the image data, paths, segmentations
and solid model constructed.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Page 11

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

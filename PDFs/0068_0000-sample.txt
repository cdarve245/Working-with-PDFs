1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is the fifth of most common congenital cardiovascular defect, [1] accounting for
8-11% of congenital heart defects in the U.S and affecting approximately
1 out
of 10,000 individuals of all ages [2, 3].
CoA refers to a narrowing of any section of the aorta; however, CoA is
most
commonly seen in the area immediately after the transverse arch,
where the ductus arteriosus inserts (Figure 1) [4]. During the first week
of
birth, when the ductus arteriosus typically closes and the tissue in the
area
becomes constricted, this may cause narrowing of the aorta [4]. CoA is
usually diagnosed in the newborn period when absent or weak femoral
pulses are detected on physical exam, or in the most severe cases, when
the
Figure 1 - Coarctation of the Aorta
baby presents in cardiogenic shock. In older patients, the most common
symptom is high blood pressure, which may be detected as early as the first week of birth [4] but more often,
and in milder cases, it may not be detected until early adolescence [5]. Overall, CoA is usually diagnosed before
age 40 [5].
CoA is usually treated soon after diagnosis using surgical methods or
transcatheter techniques (balloon angioplasty/stenting). Surgical procedures
most commonly performed include end-to-end anastomosis, end-to-side
anastomosis, and subclavian
flap
repair [6, 2]. For end-to-end
anastomosis, the narrowed
segment of the aorta is removed
and
Figure 2 - End-to-end anastomosis
both ends of the aorta are
for coarctation of the aorta
brought together (Figure 2) [6].
For
end-to-side anastomosis, the narrowed segment of the aorta may
or may
not be removed. Most commonly, the narrowed segment is tied
or

removed and the descending aorta is reattached to a separate Figure 4 - Two examples of end-to-side
incision
anastomosis for coarctation of the aorta

Figure 5 – left subclavian patch

angioplasty for coarctation of

to the undersurface of the aorta (Figure 3a) [7, 8]. Rarely, the narrowed
segment is not removed and a jump graft may be used to connect the
descending aorta to the aortic arch proximal to
the coarctation (Figure 3b). When the
coarctation involves a large segment of the
aorta, left subclavian patch angioplasty may be
performed, where the left subclavian artery is
incised longitudinally and the subclavian artery
flap is then folded over the segment where the
aorta was narrowed. (Figure 4 ) [9, 10].

Balloon angioplasty may be used as initial treatment or, more commonly, to
treat recoarctation in patients that have previously undergone surgery. This

procedure consists of inserting a balloon catheter into the constricted aorta and inflating the balloon to expand
the narrowed segment. In patients in adolescent years or older, a stent may be placed in the expanded area
after balloon angioplasty is performed (Figure 5) [6].
Despite the various options for treatment, CoA has been associated with decreased in life expectancy and long
term morbidity [2]. For this reason, further investigation on treatment outcomes, including hemodynamics, is
important. Research attempting to identify hemodynamic differences that may allow the utilization of blood
flow simulation for surgical decision making is already underway. This includes in vivo animal models that help
ensure heterogeneity in study cohorts and add the value of experimental information otherwise not obtainable
in patients. The model presented below makes an addition to public data that may be used for verification and
validation of blood flow computational models and encourages novel studies for coarctation of the aorta.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
The scans represent the aorta of adult (32-36 weeks of age) male New Zealand white rabbits (Error! Reference
source not found.). Image data was previously featured in a peer reviewed publication that quantifies
coarctation-induced mechanical alterations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis [11]. For more
information on the surgical state of each rabbit refer to this publication [11]. MRA image data for MARQ0069
was acquired using a 3T GE Sigma Excite scanner [11]. Angiocath IV was inserted into the left marginal vein to
contrast-enhance the aorta. Details of the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details
on image data orientation.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at each outlet. For more information refer to Exhibit 1 and
Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean flow to each outlet was calculated.
Volumetric flow to each outlet vessel was distributed to the major branches of arch of the aorta based on PCMRI
data and other assumptions. For more information refer to Menon et. al. [11].

6. Simulation Results
Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview (Kitware, Clifton Park, NY), an opensource scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity
magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in Table 8 for each model.

Information on how RCR values were obtained is included in Appendix 5. For all simulations, an initial ratio of
0.056 was used to calculate the TAC. The ratio was then adjusted to match the target pressures at the inlet. The
final TAC was based on the final adjusted ratio. RCR parameters for each simulation are shown in the tables
below.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

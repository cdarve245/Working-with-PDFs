1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Congenital heart defects are structural abnormalities present at birth that disrupt normal blood flow through
the heart, affecting 8 of every 1,000 newborns [1]. There are at least 18 documented types of congenital heart
defects, including coarcataion of the aorta, single ventricle defects, and complete atrioventricular canal defect
[2]. A large amount of anatomical variation is present within these individual congenital heart defect types.
In a study that examined congenital heart disease in the general population, the prevalence of single ventricle
defects was found to be 0.13 per 1000 children and 0.03 per 1000 adults [3]. Single ventricle defects cover a set
of cardiac abnormalities that result in one of the two ventricles being underdeveloped. With one ventricle being
of inadequate functionality or size, only one ventricle is available to pump the blood throughout the entire body.
Some examples of single ventricle defects include: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia, tricuspid
atresia, and double inlet left ventricle [2] [4]. Single ventricle heart patients are severely cyanotic at birth, and
these conditions are fatal with no interventions.
In order to provide adequate oxygenation, and separate the pulmonary and
systemic blood supplies, the blood returning to the heart is surgically redirected
to the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the heart. This surgical course typically
consists of three staged surgeries, a Blalock Taussig (BT) shunt and/or Norwood
procedure, a Glenn procedure, and finally a Fontan procedure (or total
cavopulmonary connection, TCPC).
The first stage is performed immediately after birth, and can vary among
patients depending on the defect and the pulmonary resistances. A systemic1 –Systemic-pulmonary shunt
pulmonary shunt (BT shunt, central shunt, or Sano shunt) is used to maintain Figure

adequate ventricle volume load and providing sufficient pulmonary blood flow.
This is accomplished by connecting a systemic artery, such as the brachocephalic artery, to the pulmonary
arteries with a tube graft (Figure 1) [4] [5]. For situations where there is too much blood flow to the lungs, the
pulmonary artery can be narrowed with a synthetic band to restrict blood flow [4]. In patients with aortic
atresia, a neo-aorta is also constructed during the first stage of surgery. About 65-80% of hypoplastic left
ventricles have been found to be related to aortic atresia in several reviews [6]. During reconstruction of a neoaorta, the distal stump of the pulmonary artery and homograft tissue are used to
direct flow through the ascending aorta to the carotid and subclavian arteries [6, 7].

Arrows represent blood flow,

blood, red being oxygenated
blood, and purple being a mix
of both.

The second stage is typically completed between the ages of 2-6 months [5]. The
Glenn procedure connects the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery in
order to improve oxygenation and decrease ventricle volume load (Figure 2) [8]. If
the patient had previously gone through a stage one procedure, it is removed during
stage two [4]. Oxygen saturation in patients who have undergone the Glenn
procedure typically is between 75-85% [4]. Another variation of the second stage is
the hemi-Fontan, where the pulmonary artery and superior vena cava are connected
through the right atrium and closed off to the rest of heart with a patch.

The third stage, a complete Fontan procedure, is typically completed between the ages of 1-5 years [5]. This
final stage redirects the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery. In combination with the previous stage,
deoxygenated blood bypasses the heart completely and is routed directly to the pulmonary artery so the single
ventricle is only pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body. A complete Fontan procedure is typically
done through a lateral tunnel or extracardiac method. A lateral
tunnel Fontan incorporates the wall of the atrium with a baffle
from the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery. On the
other hand, an extracardiac Fontan connects the inferior vena
cava to the pulmonary artery with a synthetic tube-shaped graft,
bypassing the heart altogether (Figure 3) [4]. In both methods, a
small hole, or fenestration, is often needed between the newly
formed channel and the atrium to reduce pressure in the Fontan

circuit [4] [5]. A complete Fontan procedure increases oxygen Fontan (leff), Extracardiac Fontan (right). Arrows represent

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 5 - Windkessel model

Page 11

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.,
causing about 25% of total deaths in the U.S [1, 2]. Coronary artery stenosis and occlusion is caused by plague
build up, often fatty materials resulting in atherosclerosis, in the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle
resulting in ischemia. Coronary artery bypass grafts are used to reroute blood to the heart when coronaries
have significant narrowing.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
Details of the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details on image data orientation.
Table 1 – Patient-specific volumetric image data details (mm). Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left
(R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction.

3. Anatomic Model Description
Anatomic models were created using customized SimVascular software (Simtk.org) and the image data
described in Section 2. The models include the ascending aorta and coronary arteries of interest and may extend
to the location to the descending aorta just above the celiac trunk. See

Inlet Boundary Conditions

A typical aortic waveform was prescribed to the inlet of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Figure
1). The waveform was scaled to be consistent with the cardiac output and heart rate calculated from clinical
data. See Table 6 for the period and prescribed cardiac inflow for each simulation.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at the descending aorta, subclavian, and carotid outlets. For
more information refer on RCR parameters to Exhibit 1 and Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the
Windkessel model the mean flow to the aorta outlet was assumed to be 96% of the cardiac output. The
coronary arteries were assumed to take 4% of the cardiac output with a split of 60% and 40% for the left and
right coronary arteries respectively. Lumped parameter boundary conditions were applied at the coronary
outlets using the coupled domain method [3]. Coronary boundary condition parameters were tuned to match
target flow splits and pressures. Coronary Boundary parameters can be found in Exhibit 1. Target Pressures for
both models were set based on clinically acquired data. See Table 6 for target flow splits and pressures.

Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview (Kitware, Clifton Park, NY), an opensource scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity
magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in
Table 8 for the simulation.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 3 - Windkessel model

Page 12

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

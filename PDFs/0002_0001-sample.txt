1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.,
causing about 25% of total deaths in the U.S [1, 2]. Coronary artery stenosis and occlusion is caused by plague
build up, often fatty materials resulting in atherosclerosis, in the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle
resulting in ischemia. Coronary Artery aneurysms are also caused by atherosclerosis or other disease; however
coronary artery aneurysms are less common with incidence varying from 1.5-5% [3]. The most common sites for
coronary aneurysms, in order of highest to lowest frequency are the: (1) proximal Left anterior descending
artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA), (2) left main coronary artery (LMCA), (3) left circumflex artery
(LCX), (4) and lastly the junction between the RCA and right posterior descending artery (RPD) [4].
Understanding blood flow may serve as the basis for understanding coronary artery disease and aneurysm
formation and considering therapeutic options.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
Details of the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details on image data orientation.
Table 1 – Patient-specific volumetric image data details (mm). Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left
(R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction.

Inlet Boundary Conditions

A typical aortic waveform was prescribed to the inlet of the model for 0002_0001. The waveform was obtained
from a study by Cheng et. al., which quantified blood flow through the pulmonary circulation [5]. Since
pulmonary blood flow is in series with the systemic blood flow it was assumed the amount of blood flow in the
pulmonary circulation was approximately equal to that of the systemic circulation and the waveforms were
similar. The inflow waveform used for the simulations was scaled to have a mean volumetric flow rate of 5 L/min
and a period of 1 second (60 beats per minute). Likewise, a typical aortic waveform was used for 0186_0001 and
scaled to have a mean volumetric flow rate of 5 L/min.
Inflow waveforms were prescribed to the inlets of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models (Figure 1). See
Table 6 for the period and prescribed cardiac inflow for each simulation.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at the aorta outlet for each model. For more information refer
on RCR parameters to Exhibit 1 and Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean
flow to the aorta outlet was assumed to be 96% of the cardiac output. The coronary arteries were assumed to
take 4% of the cardiac output with a split of 60% and 40% for the left and right coronary arteries respectively.
Lumped parameter boundary conditions were applied at the coronary outlets using the coupled domain method
[6]. Coronary boundary condition parameters were tuned to match target flow splits and pressures. Coronary
Boundary parameters can be found in Exhibit 1. Target Pressures for both models were set based on typical
pressures for healthy adults. See Table 6 for target flow splits and pressures.

Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview (Kitware, Clifton Park, NY), an opensource scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity
magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in

Table 8 for each model.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 3 - Windkessel model

Page 11

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

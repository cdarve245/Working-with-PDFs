1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Stoke is the number 4 leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 137,000 people a year [1]. An
estimated 5-15% of stroke cases are related to intracranial aneurysm rupture [2]. If an aneurysm ruptures and
subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs, risk of death is up to 45% within thirty days and risk of severe brain damage is
20 to 30% [3]. Prevalence of aneurysms is estimated in about 1% to 5% of the general population; however only
a small number are symptomatic or rupture [2]. About 3 to 5 million people in the U.S have cerebral aneurysms
[3].
Cerebral aneurysms usually develop after age of 40 and the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a
ruptured aneurysm peaks in peoples between the ages of 55 and 60 [2, 3]. Little is known about the formation
and cause of cerebral aneurysms however they frequently develop at sites where blood is most turbulent and
wall shear forces are greatest [4]. Cerebral aneurysms have been associated with hypertension, smokinginduced vascular changes, drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine, brain trauma, and autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease [3, 2].
Aneurysms can be saccular, also known as a berry aneurysm, with a well-defined
neck or a wide-necked and fusiform (Figure 1) [3, 5]. They are classified by size as
small (less than 5mm), medium (6-15mm), large (16-25 mm) and giant (larger than
25mm) [3]. The two most common sites where cerebral aneurysms form are in the
anterior communicating artery and at the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery
and the posterior communicating artery; 60% to 70% of aneurysms occur at those
sites. Aneurysms at the middle cerebral artery bifurcation and basilar artery
bifurcation are also common and most other aneurysms occur in the posterior
circulation arteries [4].

There are two main options for treating cerebral aneurysms: clipping and coiling.
Permanent clips made from MRI-compatible alloys are placed across the neck of saccular aneurysms to prevent
rupture (Figure 2) [2]. If a cerebral aneurysm ruptures, it is often treated using coiling, where detachable coils of
various sizes and shapes are inserted in the aneurysm to stop blood from entering the aneurysm [2]. Aneurysms
treated with coiling may recur as a result of coil compression by the aneurysm, allowing blood to flow to the
aneurysm. One potential solution to recurring aneurysms is
stent-assisted recoiling, where a microcatheter-delivered stent
is placed in the vicinity of the aneurysm, blocking flow to the
aneurysm and directing it through the artery [2]. The optimal
treatment for different aneurysms remains controversial and
requires further investigation. Computational Fluid Dynamics

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

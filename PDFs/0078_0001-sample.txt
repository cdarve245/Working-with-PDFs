1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Stoke is the number 4 leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 137,000 people a year [1]. The carotid
bifurcation in the neck is the most common location of clinically significant disease. Stenosis of the proximal
internal carotid artery in the carotid bulb is a major cause of stroke and hemodynamic forces are thought to play
an important role in the pathogenesis of carotid atherosclerosis. Cerebral aneurysms may also form along the
major arteries within the brain. If an aneurysm ruptures and subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs, risk of death is
30 to 40% and risk of severe brain damage is 20 to 30% [2]. Again, information on the hemodynamics at the
major arteries deep in the brain may be important in understanding aneurysm formation.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
Details of the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details on image data orientation.

Outlet Boundary Conditions

Resistances boundary conditions were used at the outlets. A total resistance was calculated and distributed
amongst the outlets by assuming all outlets act in parallel with values inversely proportional the outlet area. A
Mean arterial pressure of 115 mmHg was assumed for these models. See the published journal article featuring
these simulations [3] for more details on boundary condition calculations and Exhibit 1 for the applied resistance
values.

6. Simulation Results
Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview (Kitware, Clifton Park, NY), an opensource scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity
magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in Table 8 for each model.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

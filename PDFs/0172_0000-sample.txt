1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Kawasaki disease is the leading cause for acquired pediatric heart disease in developed countries [1]. KD is
diagnosed in over 5,500 patients annually in the U.S [2]. It is an acute vasculitis/inflammation of vessels [1]. KD
is usually diagnosed in children under 5 years of age with an average age of 2 [2, 3]. The disease is almost twice
as common in boys as in girls [3].
The cause for the disease is unknown, however the seasonality and acute nature of cases suggests an infectious
trigger even though no causative agent has been identified. Furthermore, genetic susceptibility to the disease
and outcomes of the disease has also been observed, particularly in Asian populations. Thus, it is generally
proposed that KD results from exposure to a causative agent that triggers the disease in genetically predisposed
hosts [1].
Presented symptoms in infancy and early childhood that lead to
diagnosis include fever for at least 4 days, rashes, erythema of
the
lips and oropharynx, swollen tongue (“strawberry tongue”),
edema of the hands and feet, and erythema of the palms and
soles
often followed by periungual desquamation [1]. Coronary
aneurysms, the most serious complication related to KD may
develop in up to 25% of patients with untreated KD and
increase the risk of thrombosis, stenotic lesions, and myocardial
infarction [2, 1]. Duration of fever has shown to correlate
strongly with increased risk for coronary aneurysms. The most
Figure 1: Common Sites of coronary
common sites for coronary aneurysms, in order of highest to
aneurysms for KD patients
lowest frequency are the: (1) proximal Left anterior descending
artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA), (2) left main coronary artery (LMCA), (3) left circumflex artery
(LCX), (4) and lastly the junction between the RCA and right posterior descending artery (RPD) (Figure 1) [4].
KD patients are usually treated with aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [1]. Aspirin serves to reduce
acute symptoms while IVIG is thought to reduce the risk of developing coronary aneurysms from 25% to 3-5% if
administered within 10 days after fever onset [1]. Conticosteriods, pentoxifylline, ulinastatin, abciximab and
other drugs may also be used as treatment, and are sometimes used when
IVIG treatments fail. Echoardiography is then used to evaluate cardiac state
and assess appropriate longitudinal follow-up treatment. Children can usually
return to normal activity after the acute episode subsides, however if cardiac
anomalities are detected periodic clinical assessment after the acute episode
is scheduled [5]. If an initially detected coronary aneurysm does not
disappear properly or if an aneurysm develops in the long-term, the aneurysm
often narrows in attempt to heal resulting in a stenosis or a blood clot in the
aneurysm site may also cause obstruction. Obstructive lesions in Kawasaki
patients are usually treated with a coronary artery bypass graft, where an
artery or vein from the patient is used to bypass the obstruction and provide
blood downstream of the obstruction (Figure 2). The use of stenting,
Figure 2: Coronary artery bypass graft
rotational ablation, and balloon angioplasty has been limited in Kawasaki
patients and are often unfavorable alternatives to coronary artery bypass [4].

Inlet Boundary Conditions

For all datasets except 0184_0000, a typical aortic waveform was prescribed to the inlet of the computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Figure 3). The waveform was scaled to be consistent with the cardiac output and
heart rate calculated from clinical data. For 0184_0000 the waveform was calculated using PC-MRI data. See
Table 6 for the period and prescribed cardiac inflow for each simulation.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at the descending aorta, subclavian, and carotid outlets. For
more information refer on RCR parameters to Exhibit 1 and Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the
Windkessel model the mean flow to the aorta outlet was assumed to be 96% of the cardiac output. The
coronary arteries were assumed to take 4% of the cardiac output with a split of 60% and 40% for the left and
right coronary arteries respectively. Lumped parameter boundary conditions were applied at the coronary
outlets using the coupled domain method [2]. Coronary boundary condition parameters were tuned to match
target flow splits and pressures. Coronary Boundary parameters can be found in Exhibit 1. Target Pressures for
both models were set based on clinically acquired data. See Table 6 for target flow splits and pressures.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

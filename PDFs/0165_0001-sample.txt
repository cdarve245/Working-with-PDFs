1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.,
causing about 25% of total deaths in the U.S [1, 2]. Coronary artery stenosis and occlusion is caused by plague
build up, often fatty materials resulting in atherosclerosis, in the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle
resulting in ischemia. Coronary Artery aneurysms are also caused by atherosclerosis or other disease; however
coronary artery aneurysms are less common with incidence varying from 1.5-5% [3]. The most common sites for
coronary aneurysms, in order of highest to lowest frequency are the: (1) proximal Left anterior descending
artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA), (2) left main coronary artery (LMCA), (3) left circumflex artery
(LCX), (4) and lastly the junction between the RCA and right posterior descending artery (RPD) [4].
Understanding blood flow may serve as the basis for understanding coronary artery disease and aneurysm
formation and considering therapeutic options.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
All scans are for the same patient. The data for 0158_0000 is CT and was taken preoperatively. Data for
0164_0000 and 165_0000 is Optical-CT (OCT), a series of individual 2D images, and was taken postoperatively.
Data for 0164_000 was taken immediately post-stent and data for 0165_0000 was taken 6 months after stent
implantation. Details of the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. Note that there is no volumetric
information for the OCT in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details on image data orientation.

Inlet Boundary Conditions

A canine pulsatile blood flow waveform contour obtained from the left anterior descending coronary artery was
scaled and prescribed to the LCX inlet of the models [5]. The flow to the LCX was determined assuming that the
coronary arteries receive 5% of the flow and the left coronaries receive 84% of the total coronary flow. It was
then assumed that the LCX received 33% of the flow that goes to the left coronaries. See Table 6 for the period
and prescribed cardiac output for each simulation. Prescribed inflow waveforms for each simulation are shown
in Figure 1.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at the aorta outlet for each model. For more information refer
on RCR parameters to Exhibit 1 and Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean
flow to each outlet was calculated. For 0164 and 0165 flow split to the dLCX and OM2 were calculated assuming
that wall shear stress was the same for both outlet arteries. For more information you may refer to the
publication featuring these models [5]. Flow distributions are shown in Table 7.

magnitude for two time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

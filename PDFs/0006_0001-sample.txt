1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Studying the hemodynamics of the vasculature distal to the abdominal aorta may be important in understanding
common diseases in peripheral arteries downstream of the thoracic aorta. Diseases in the peripheral vasculature
affect millions of people in the U.S and can have a profound effect on daily quality of life.
Peripheral arterial disease is the build-up of fatty tissue, or atherosclerosis, in lower extremity arteries. By 2001
at least 10 million people in the U.S were estimated to have peripheral arterial disease. The prevalence of
peripheral arterial occlusive disease increases with age and can increase to up to 20% of the population in the
geriatric population [1]. Up to 4 million people in the U.S suffer from intermittent claudication causing pain in
the legs during exercise. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremity arteries is a major cause of
walking impairment, pain, ulcerations and gangrene.
Renal artery stenosis can have a prevalence of up to 45% in selective populations, specifically populations with
other vascular disease. Prevalence can be from 1-6% in hypertensive patients to 30-45% in patients with
aortoiliac occlusive disease or abdominal aortic aneurysms [1]. It is most often caused by atherosclerosis in the
renal arteries and is often undetected until symptoms become severe. The most common symptom of renal
artery stenosis is hypertension, which can have significant effects on the entire vascularture. Up to 24% of
patients with renal insuffiency, which can lead to end-stage renal disease renal disease, had renal artery
stenosis, suggesting that renal artery stenosis may play an important role in kidney failure [1].

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.

Inlet Boundary Conditions

For 0003_0000 the inflow waveform was adapted from Olufsen et. al. and then smoothed [2]. The mean value
of the inflow waveform was reasonably in the range of mean cardiac output of 4.6 L/min given for women in
Collis and the standard 5.0 L/min given in Berne and Levy [3, 4].
For 0006_0000, clinically acquired patient height and weight were used to calculate patient BSA based on the
Moseller equation. The BSA was then used to calculate the cardiac output based on the Baker equation. Flow to
the supraceliac aorta was assumed to be 66% of the cardiac output [5, 6]. Patient-specific inflow waveforms
were created by scaling a gender-matched representative supraceliac aortic waveform.
Inflow waveforms were prescribed to the inlets of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models (Figure 1). See
Table 6 for the period and prescribed cardiac inflow for each simulation.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at each outlet. For more information refer to Exhibit 1 and
Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean flow to each outlet was calculated. For
both 0003 and 0006 various literature sources were used to calcite the outflow to each artery. Target flow splits
are shown in

Table 7.
0003_0000: It is thought that 10-18% of total cardiac output goes to the brain [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. From this range,
13% of cardiac output to the brain was selected (6.5% to each carotid artery). Because 65% of cardiac output is
thought to go down the descending thoracic aorta, then the remaining 22% of cardiac output was assumed to
enter the subclavian arteries (11% to each subclavian) [12]. The thoracic aortic flow (65% of the total cardiac
output) is equal to the flow entering the abdominal aorta at the supraceliac level. The amount of flow entering
the infrarenal aorta was determined from a ratio of infrarenal to supraceliac flow from Cheng and colleagues
[13]. Because the supraceliac and infrarenal flow were calculated, the total amount of flow exiting the upper
branch vessels (the hepatic, splenic, SMA, and left and right renal arteries) could be determined. This flow to the
upper branch vessels was distributed to each upper branch vessel according to measurements made by Moore
and Ku [14]. The remaining aortic infrarenal flow was divided equally to the right and left common iliac arteries.
From each common iliac artery, each external iliac artery received 70% and each internal iliac received 30% of
the common iliac flow flow [15]. The desired flow to the right and left femoral, profunda, and external
circumflex arteries was based approximately on the areas of their outlets.
0006_0000: Flow to the supraceliac aorta was taken as 66% of the cardiac output [5, 6]. From the supraceliac
flow 21.7% was prescribed to the celiac artery and 14.7% to the superior mesenteric artery [16]. The flow to the
celiac artery was split evenly between the hepatic and splenic artery. About 23.3% of cardiac output is thought
to go to the kidneys [17]. This flow was also split evenly between the right and left renal arteries. This leaves
29.8% of the remaining flow from the supraceliac aorta to flow through the infrarenal aorta, which is consistent
with findings from Cheng et. al. based on PCMRI flow data collected in healthy male subjects ages 20 to 24 years
[18]. The remaining flow to the infrarenal aorta was then split evenly between the left and right common iliac
arteries. That flow was then distributed to the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at a 70% and 30% of the
common iliac artery flow respectively.
Target Pressures for 0003_0000 were set based on typical pressures for healthy adults, while target pressures
for 0006_0000 were based on clinically-acquired pressure measurements. See Table 6 for target pressures.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 2 - Windkessel model

Page 15

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

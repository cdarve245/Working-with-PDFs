1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Stoke is the number 4 leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 137,000 people a year [1]. The carotid
bifurcation in the neck is the most common location of clinically significant disease. Stenosis of the proximal
internal carotid artery in the carotid bulb is a major cause of stroke and hemodynamic forces are thought to play
an important role in the pathogenesis of carotid atherosclerosis. Cerebral aneurysms may also form along the
major arteries within the brain. If an aneurysm ruptures and subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs, risk of death is
30 to 40% and risk of severe brain damage is 20 to 30% [2]. Again, information on the hemodynamics at the
major arteries deep in the brain may be important in understanding aneurysm formation.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.

Inlet Boundary Conditions

A typical aortic waveform was prescribed to the inlet of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Figure
1). The waveform was obtained from a study by Cheng et. al., which quantified blood flow through the
pulmonary circulation [3]. Since pulmonary blood flow is in series with the systemic blood flow it was assumed
the amount of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation was approximately equal to that of the systemic
circulation and the waveforms were similar.
See Table 6 for more inflow details.

Outlet Boundary Conditions

RCR boundary conditions were applied to each outlet. Blood flow distribution throughout the model was
determined from literature. Small vessels in which flow distribution information could not be found in literature
were assumed to receive negligible flow.
Descending Aorta and Subclavian Outflow
The amount of blood flow to the arteries branching off of the aortic arch was calculated based on the findings of
Zamir et al., which determined the relationship between flow and diameter for the first generations of the
arterial tree is regulated by the square law [4]. The diameters of the four vessels branching off of the arch were
measured in the model to determine the flow to each head and neck vessel. The remaining blood flow was
assumed to exit the model through the descending aorta. It was also assumed the right and left subclavian
arteries received equal amounts of blood flow.
External Carotid Outflow
Marshall et al. measured the blood flow distribution of the carotid bifurcation using PC-MRI [5]. While the
findings of Marshall were reported as flow rates, for the purposes of this model the flow rates were recalculated
as percentages. From the blood flow in the common carotid artery (CCA), 70% of the flow was distributed to the
internal carotid artery (ICA), and the 30% was distributed to the external carotid artery (ECA). As with the
subclavian arteries, the flow to each ECA was assumed to be equal.
Circle of Willis Outflow
The flow distribution of the cerebral arteries was determined to be 20% to the anterior cerebral arteries (ACA),
40% to the middle cerebral arteries (MCA), and 20% to the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) [6].
The compliance parameter of the 3-Element Windkessel model was determined based on the desired diastolic,
systolic, and pulse pressure values. The total arterial compliance of the model was determined by convolving the
inflow waveform with various values for Rp, Rd, and C. The ratio of Rp to the total resistance (Rp + Rd) was
always chosen to be 0.056 based on the findings of Laskey et. al. [7]. After calculating a total arterial compliance
that corresponded to a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg, the total arterial compliance was divided among the outlets
of the model such that the compliance at the outlet was proportional to the flow.
After distributing the total arterial compliance to each outlet, the local ratio of Rp to the total resistance at each
outlet was adjusted so that the desired pulse pressure was reached at each outlet. The desired pulse pressure at
the subclavian and external carotid outlets was choosen to be 40 mmHg. Selecting the desired pressure values in
the Circle of Willis was more complicated. Due to gravity, the blood pressure in the cerebral arteries varies
depending on the posture of the subject. A subject standing in an erect posture corresponds to a static pressure
difference of 20-40 mmHg between the heart and the brain [8]. Using a microcatheter, previous studies have measured the
difference between cerebral and systemic blood pressure to be between 30-50 mmHg [9, 10]. For this model, the aimed
pressure drop from the heart to head was chosen to be about 30 mmHg, but since gravity was not simulated a pressure
drop less than 30 mmHg was expected. The pulse pressure in the cerebral vasculature was also difficult to define because of
the difficulty associated with accurately measuring peak systolic and diastolic pressures using a microcatheter [11]. For the
model, an a priori estimate of the ratio of Rp to the total resistance at each cerebral outlet was calculated assuming a pulse
pressure of 40 mmHg, but with the understanding that this would likely be much less in the model.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Studying the hemodynamics of the vasculature distal to the abdominal aorta may be important in understanding
common diseases in peripheral arteries downstream of the thoracic aorta. Diseases in the peripheral vasculature
affect millions of people in the U.S and can have a profound effect on daily quality of life.
Peripheral arterial disease is the build-up of fatty tissue, or atherosclerosis, in lower extremity arteries. By 2001
at least 10 million people in the U.S were estimated to have peripheral arterial disease. The prevalence of
peripheral arterial occlusive disease increases with age and can increase to up to 20% of the population in the
geriatric population [1]. Up to 4 million people in the U.S suffer from intermittent claudication causing pain in
the legs during exercise. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremity arteries is a major cause of
walking impairment, pain, ulcerations and gangrene.
Renal artery stenosis can have a prevalence of up to 45% in selective populations, specifically populations with
other vascular disease. Prevalence can be from 1-6% in hypertensive patients to 30-45% in patients with
aortoiliac occlusive disease or abdominal aortic aneurysms [1]. It is most often caused by atherosclerosis in the
renal arteries and is often undetected until symptoms become severe. The most common symptom of renal
artery stenosis is hypertension, which can have significant effects on the entire vascularture. Up to 24% of
patients with renal insuffiency, which can lead to end-stage renal disease renal disease, had renal artery
stenosis, suggesting that renal artery stenosis may play an important role in kidney failure [1].

2. Clinical Data

3. Anatomic Model Description
Anatomic models were created using customized SimVascular software (Simtk.org) and the image data
described in Section 2. The aortofemoral model extends from the supraceliac aorta to the femoral and profunda
femoris artery bifurcation. See

Inlet Boundary Conditions

A supraceliac aorta blood flow waveform derived from PC-MRI data was prescribed to the inlet of the
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Figure 1). See Table 7 for the period and cardiac output for each
simulation. Note that the cardiac output is not the same as the supraceliac flow, or the flow prescribed at the
inlet. The flow to the supraceliac aorta from PC-MRI was 4.04 L/min.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at each outlet. For more information refer to Exhibit 1 and
Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean flow to each outlet were calculated
from PC-MRI data. PCMRI data was available transverse to the celiac trunk, SMA, right superior and inferior
renal arteries, left superior and inferior renal arteries, infrarenal aorta, supra-IMA aorta, infra-IMA aorta, right
common iliac, and left common iliac. For larger arteries (i.e. supraceliac, infrarenal, supra-IMA and infra-IMA
aorta), manual or threshold intensity magnitude segmentation techniques were used to calculate the flow. For
medium-sized arteries (i.e. celiac trunk, SMA, left iliac and right iliac), maximum number of intensity pixels were
included in PCMRI segmentations to calculate flow. For smaller arteries (i.e. renal arteries), pixels within the
artery lumen that form reasonable flow waveforms were hand-picked and tagged to calculate flow. The
supraceliac aortic flow, also calculated from PC-MRI, was assumed to be 66% of the cardiac output. Flows
calculated from PCMRI were then scaled so that the sum of the flow going to all arteries in the abdominal aorta
would equal 66% of the cardiac output. See Table 8 for target flow splits and target pressures used (based on
pressure for healthy adult males).

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Pulmonary arteries connect blood flow from the heart to the lungs in order to oxygenate blood before being
pumped through the body. The main pulmonary artery (MPA) starts at the right ventricle of the heart and
divides into the left (LPA) and right pulmonary arteries (RPA), which branch out into the lungs. The main
pulmonary artery in healthy subjects has an average diameter of 2.72 cm. Anatomical differences in MPA
diameter have also been documented between genders, with a mean MPA diameter of 2.77 cm for males
and 2.64 cm for females [1].
Examples of complications seen in the pulmonary arteries include pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary
embolisms. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease that occurs when the blood vessels
between the heart and lungs narrow and harden, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries [2]. The
increased resistance makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs, adding strain to and
weakening the right ventricle. PAH is a serious condition, with a median survival of less than 3 years if left
untreated [3],causing over 15,000 deaths and 260,000 hospital visits in the United States in 2002 [4].
Significant vascular remodeling is observed in PAH patients, with larger proximal pulmonary arteries and
more convoluted branches when compared to healthy patients (Figure 1). In a study examining threedimensional hemodynamics of the pulmonary arteries, PAH patients were found to have an average main
pulmonary diameter of 3.5 ± 0.5 cm, where healthy patients had an average of 2.7 ± 0.1 cm [3].
A pulmonary embolism is another condition seen the pulmonary arteries, involving one or more arteries
being blocked by a blood clot. The blood clots typically originate elsewhere in the body and travel to the
pulmonary arteries. The effects of a pulmonary embolism can be quiet severe, with the first sign being
sudden death in 25% of pulmonary embolism cases [5]. However, prompt application of anti-clogging
medication can help avoid mortality and further complications [6].

3. Anatomic Model Description
Anatomic models were created using customized SimVascular software (Simtk.org) and the image data
described in Section 2. The models extend from the main pulmonary artery to various levels of branching in the
left and right pulmonary arteries. See Appendix 2 for a description of modeling methods. See Error! Reference
source not found. for a visual summary of the image data, paths, segmentations and solid model constructed.

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.

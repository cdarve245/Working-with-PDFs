1. Clinical Significance & Condition
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is the fifth of most common congenital cardiovascular defect, [1] accounting for
8-11% of congenital heart defects in the U.S and affecting approximately 1 out of 10,000 individuals of all ages
[2, 3].
CoA refers to a narrowing of any section of the aorta; however, CoA is most
commonly seen in the area immediately after the transverse arch, where the
ductus arteriosus inserts (Figure 1) [4]. During the first week of birth, when the
ductus arteriosus typically closes and the tissue in the area becomes
constricted, this may cause narrowing of the aorta [4]. CoA is usually
diagnosed in the newborn period when absent or weak femoral pulses are
detected on physical exam, or in the most severe cases, when the baby
presents in cardiogenic shock. In older patients, the most common symptom is Figure 1 - Coarctation of the Aorta
high blood pressure, which may be detected as early as the first week of birth
[4] but more often, and in milder cases, it may not be detected until early adolescence [5]. Overall, CoA is usually
diagnosed before age 40 [5].
CoA is usually treated soon after diagnosis using surgical methods or
transcatheter techniques (balloon angioplasty/stenting). Surgical procedures
most commonly performed include end-to-end anastomosis, end-to-side
anastomosis, and subclavian flap repair [6, 2]. For end-to-end anastomosis, the
narrowed segment of the aorta is
removed and both ends of the aorta are
brought together (Figure 2) [6]. For endFigure 2 - End-to-end anastomosis
to-side anastomosis, the narrowed
for coarctation of the aorta
segment of the aorta may or may not be
removed. Most commonly, the narrowed segment is tied or removed and
the descending aorta is reattached to a separate incision to the
undersurface of the aorta (Figure 3a) [7, 8]. Rarely, the narrowed segment
(a)
(b)
is not removed and a jump graft may be
Figure 3 - Two examples of end-to-side
anastomosis for coarctation of the aorta
used to connect the descending aorta to
the aortic arch proximal to the coarctation (Figure 3b). When the coarctation
involves a large segment of the aorta, left subclavian patch angioplasty may be
performed, where the left subclavian artery is incised longitudinally and the
subclavian artery flap is then folded over the segment where the aorta was
narrowed. (Figure 4 ) [9, 10].
Balloon angioplasty may be used as initial treatment or, more commonly, to
treat recoarctation in patients that have previously undergone surgery. This
angioplasty for coarctation of
procedure consists of inserting a balloon catheter into the constricted aorta
the aorta
and inflating the balloon to expand the narrowed segment. In patients in
adolescent years or older, a stent may be placed in the expanded area after balloon angioplasty is performed
(Figure 5) [6].

Despite the various options for treatment, CoA has been associated with
decreased in life expectancy and long term morbidity [2]. For this reason, further
investigation on treatment outcomes, including hemodynamics, is important.
Research attempting to identify hemodynamic differences that may allow the
utilization of blood flow simulation for surgical decision making is already
underway. This includes in vivo animal models that help ensure heterogeneity in
study cohorts and add the value of experimental information otherwise not
obtainable in patients. The model presented below makes an addition to public
data that may be used for verification and validation of blood flow computational
models and encourages novel studies for coarctation of the aorta.

2. Clinical Data
Patient-specific volumetric image data was obtained to create physiological models and blood flow simulations.
For more information on the image data refer to the publications featuring these simulations [11] [12]. Details of
the imaging data used can be seen in Table 1. See Appendix 1 for details on image data orientation.

Anatomic models were created using customized SimVascular software (Simtk.org) and the image data
described in Section 2. The models extend from the ascending aorta to the location in the descending aorta just
above the diaphragm. See Appendix 2 for a description of modeling methods. See Table 3 for a visual summary
of the image data, paths, segmentations and solid model constructed.

5. 3 Outlet Boundary Conditions
A three element Windkessel model was applied at each outlet. For more information refer to Exhibit 1 and
Appendix 5. To define the parameters in the Windkessel model the mean flow to each outlet was calculated.
Volumetric flow to each outlet vessel was distributed to the major branches of arch of the aorta based on PCMRI
data and other assumptions. For more information refer to LaDisa et al. [2].

6. Simulation Results
Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview (Kitware, Clifton Park, NY), an opensource scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity
magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen in Table 7 for each model.

Information on how RCR values were obtained is included in Appendix 5. For all simulations, an initial ratio of
0.056 was used to calculate the TAC. The ratio was then adjusted to match the target pressures at the inlet. The
final TAC was based on the final adjusted ratio. RCR parameters for each simulation are shown in the tables

Appendix
1. Image Data Orientation
The RAS coordinate system was assumed for the image data orientation. Voxel Spacing, voxel dimensions, and
physical dimensions are provided in the Right-Left (R), Anterior-Posterior (A), and Superior-Inferior (S) direction
in all specification documents unless otherwise specified.

2. Model Construction
All anatomic models were constructed in RAS Space. The models are generated by selecting centerline paths
along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations
together to create a solid model. A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was
used to generate a single model representing the complete anatomic model. The vessel junctions were then
blended to create a smoothed model.

3. Physiological Assumptions
Newtonian fluid behavior is assumed with standard physiological properties. Blood viscosity and density are
given below in units used to input directly into the solver.
Blood Viscosity: 0.04 g/cm•s2
Blood Density: 1.06 g/cm3

4. Simulation Parameters
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid
and non-slip walls. All simulations were ran in cgs units and ran for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate
and pressure fields to stabilize.

5. Outlet Boundary Conditions
5.1 Resistance Methods
Resistances values can be applied to the outlets to direct flow and pressure gradients. Total
resistance for the model is calculated using relationships of the flow and pressure of the model.
Total resistance is than distributed amongst the outlets using an inverse relationship of outlet area
and the assumption that the outlets act in parallel.
5.2 Windkessel Model
In order to represent the effects of vessels distal to
the CFD model, a three-element Windkessel model
can be applied at each outlet. This model consists of
proximal resistance (Rp), capacitance (C), and distal
resistance (Rd) representing the resistance of the
proximal vessels, the capacitance of the proximal
vessels, and the resistance of the distal vessels
downstream of each outlet, respectively (Figure 1).

Page 16

First, total arterial capacitance (TAC) was calculated using inflow and blood pressure. The TAC was
then distributed among the outlets based on the blood flow distributions. Next, total resistance (Rt)
was calculated for each outlet using mean blood pressure and PC-MRI or calculated target flow
(Rt=Pmean/Qdesired). Given that Rt=Rp+Rd, total resistance was distributed between Rp and Rd adjusting
the Rp to Rt ratio for each outlet.
